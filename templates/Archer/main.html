<h1>Archer</h1>

<p>Archer follows the exploits of alcoholic, sex-addicted, mommaâ€™s boy and super spy Sterling Archer and his variety of coworkers. This show may be animated but it is definitely not for kids. The amount of sex, drugs and murder would definitely scar anyone who is used to watching Nickelodeon.

<p>Each episode is for the most part independent; you can start watching anywhere and it will still be hilarious but I would recommend starting at the beginning. Archer does an amazing job of creating inside jokes with the audience that become funnier and funnier as time goes on.
